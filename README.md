# react-native-typescript-template
Base React-Native project with typescript and jest.

## Setup
* Clone this project.
* Run `npm install` or `yarn install`

## What's this?
This is a project that be configured using this [TUTORIAL](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/blog/2018/05/07/using-typescript-with-react-native.html).

It's provide a full configuration for React-Native (not Expo) with Typescript and Jest.

This repository will be updated when bugs or new cool features cound be added.

## Why?
I really hate to re-configure base boilerplates for projects and "complex" configurations like Typescript with Jest should be automatic.
